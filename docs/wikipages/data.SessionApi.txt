While with AMQP 0-8 it was sufficient to assume

 - TCP
 - no channel living longer than an individual TCP connection

this is no longer sufficient. With AMQP 0-10, other transports have been specified, and sessions have been split out as a transport-independent notion.

In our current (0-8) Java client, our ConnectionParameters/ConnectionFactory objects contain settings for
 - Username
 - Password
 - Virtual Host
 - Channel Max
 - Frame Max
 - Heartbeat interval
 - AccessRequest suppression
 - a list of Addresses (Hostname/Portnumber pairs) where the broker is reachable

These need splitting up.

@table
  TCP connection configuration
  || General connection configuration

  - Hostname/Portnumber
  - Channel Max
  - Frame Max
  || - Username
  || - Password
  || - Virtual Host
  || - AccessRequest suppression

So, let's define a bunch of entities.

 - Peer: a broker/client/server/proxy/etc. An addressable AMQP [b thing].
   - has a list of Endpoints, in order of preference.
   - can open Connections, via its Endpoints
 - Endpoint: a means of reaching a peer - an address for a peer
   - supplied to a Peer; otherwise not part of the main API
   - Variants:
     - TcpEndpoint
       - host
       - port (may vary with spec protocol version)
     - SctpEndpoint
     - UdpEndpoint, HttpEndpoint etc etc
 - Connection: an open, authenticated network-level virtual circuit between two peers, supporting associations
   - knows the Peer to which it is connected
   - can create new or reattach to existing Sessions
   - Variants for TCP, SCTP, UDP, HTTP etc etc.
 - Association: an open, available means of delivering frames along a session between two peers
   - an internal notion. The API doesn't deal with these.
 - Session: (see definition in 0-10)
