## Overview

.NET client's test suite assumes there's a RabbitMQ node listening on localhost:5672
(the default settings). SSL tests require a broker listening on the default
SSL port. Connection recovery tests assume `rabbitmqctl` at `../rabbitmq-server/scripts/rabbitmqctl`
can control the running node: this is the case when all repositories are cloned using
the [umbrella repository](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-public-umbrella).

It is possible to use [Visual Studio 2013 Community](http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/vs2013-community-vs.aspx),
`msbuild.exe`, or `xbuild` (on Mono) to build the client and run the test suite.


## Building

### Copy `Local.props.example` and Edit

First copy `Local.props.example` to `Local.props` and edit it if needed, specifying whether
you intend to build the client on Mono and what .NET version should be targeted.

### Build

Then, build in Visual Studio or build from the command line. To do the latter,
simply run

    msbuild.exe

on Windows and

    xbuild

if you use Mono.


## Running Tests

Tests can be run from Visual Studio using [NUnit Test Adapter](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/6ab922d0-21c0-4f06-ab5f-4ecd1fe7175d).
Note that it may take some time for the adapter to discover tests in the assemblies.

Running the tests from the command line is also straightforward: use

    msbuild.exe /t:RunUnitTests src/RabbitMQ.Client.Unit/RabbitMQ.Client.Unit.csproj

on Windows with .NET and

    xbuild /nologo /t:RunUnitTests src/RabbitMQ.Client.Unit/RabbitMQ.Client.Unit.csproj | grep -v "warning CS2002"

on Mono.
