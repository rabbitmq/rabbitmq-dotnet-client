This section gives an overview of the RabbitMQ .NET client API.

Only the basics of using the library are covered: for full detail,
please see the javadoc-like API documentation generated from the
source code.

** Major namespaces, interfaces and classes

The API is closely modelled on the AMQP protocol specification, with
little additional abstraction.

The core API interfaces and classes are defined in the [code
RabbitMQ.Client] namespace:

@code java
 using RabbitMQ.Client;

The core API interfaces and classes are

 - [code IModel]: represents an AMQP data channel, and provides most
   of the AMQP operations

 - [code IConnection]: represents an AMQP connection

 - [code ConnectionFactory]: constructs [code IConnection] instances

Other useful interfaces and classes include:

 - [code ConnectionParameters]: configures a [code ConnectionFactory]
 - [code QueueingBasicConsumer]: receives messages delivered from the server
 - [code Protocols]: support class for choosing an AMQP protocol variant

Public namespaces other than [code RabbitMQ.Client] include:

 - [code RabbitMQ.Client.Content]: construction and analysis of
   messages that are binary-compatible with messages produced and
   consumed by QPid's JMS compatibility layer.

 - [code RabbitMQ.Client.Events]: various events and event handlers
   that are part of the AMQP client library.

 - [code RabbitMQ.Client.Exceptions]: exceptions visible to the user
   of the AMQP client library.

All other namespaces are reserved for private implementation detail of
the library, although members of private namespaces are usually made
available to applications using the library in order to permit
developers to implement workarounds for faults or design mistakes they
discover in the library implementation. Applications cannot rely on
any classes, interfaces, member variables etc. that appear within
private namespaces remaining stable across releases of the library.

** Multi-protocol support

Class [code RabbitMQ.Client.Protocols] contains convenient predefined
[code IProtocol] instances that permit selection of a supported
protocol variant. At the time of writing, the library supports:

 - [code Protocols.DefaultProtocol]: An alias to one of the other
   protocols. At the time of writing, [b the default protocol is [code
   AMQP_0_9_1]].

 - [code Protocols.AMQP_0_8]: Standard AMQP 0-8 protocol, including
   [code access.request] and [code queue.unbind].

 - [code Protocols.AMQP_0_8_QPID]: AMQP 0-8 as extended by QPid's 0-8
   M1 release, without [code access.request] and with extra parameters
   available on certain methods.

 - [code Protocols.AMQP_0_9]: Standard AMQP 0-9 protocol, including
   [code access.request], but excluding the [code Message]
   content-class and other areas of the specification marked "work in
   progress".

 - [code Protocols.AMQP_0_9_1]: Standard AMQP 0-9-1 protocol, including
   [code access.request].

The [code basic.recover-async] method which is defined in AMQP 0-9-1 has
been backported to all supported protocol versions. The implementation of
[code basic.recover] is synchronous in all supported protocol versions.

The [code Protocols] class also contains some convenience functions
for retrieving an IProtocol from a string, from the environment or
from a .NET XML configuration file. The protocol names permitted are
the same as the static instance variables on class [code Protocols],
that is, [code AMQP_0_8], [code AMQP_0_8_QPID], [code AMQP_0_9],
, [code AMQP_0_9_1] and [code DefaultProtocol].

The following code binds [code p] to the [code Protocols.AMQP_0_9]
instance by looking it up dynamically:

@code java
  IProtocol p = Protocols.SafeLookup("AMQP_0_9");

Given the following [code App.config] snippet,

@code
  <appSettings>
    <add key="my-protocol" value="AMQP_0_9"/>
  </appSettings>

the following code will also bind [code p] to the 0-9 [code IProtocol]
implementation:

@code java
  IProtocol p = Protocols.FromConfiguration("my-protocol");

An alternative is [code Protocols.FromEnvironmentVariable()], which
reads the name of the protocol variant to return from the shell
environment variable named by [code Protocols.EnvironmentVariable] (at
the time of writing, [code AMQP_PROTOCOL]).

Finally, [code Protocols.FromEnvironment()] tries [code
FromConfiguration()] first, and if no setting is found, falls back to
[code FromEnvironmentVariable()].

If no argument is passed to [code FromEnvironment()] or [code
FromConfiguration()], the value of [code
Protocols.DefaultAppSettingsKey] is used. (At the time of writing, the
default appSettings key is [code AMQP_PROTOCOL], the same as the name
of the shell environment variable scanned.)

** Connecting to a broker

The following code connects to an AMQP broker:

@code java
 ConnectionFactory factory = new ConnectionFactory();
 factory.UserName = user;
 factory.Password = pass;
 factory.VirtualHost = vhost;
 factory.Protocol = Protocols.FromEnvironment();
 factory.HostName = hostName;
 factory.Port = AmqpTcpEndpoint.UseDefaultPort;
 IConnection conn = factory.CreateConnection();

All factory properties have default values. The default value for a property will be used if the property remains unassigned prior to creating a connection:
 - username: [code "guest"]
 - password: [code "guest"]
 - virtual-host: [code "/"]
 - protocol: [code AMQP 0-9-1]
 - hostname: [code localhost]
 - port: [code 5672]

The IConnection interface can then be used to open a channel:

@code java
 IModel channel = conn.CreateModel();

The channel can now be used to send and receive messages,
as described in subsequent sections.

** Disconnecting from a broker

To disconnect, simply close the channel and the connection:

@code java
 channel.Close(200, "Goodbye");
 conn.Close();

Note that closing the channel is considered good practice, but isn't
strictly necessary - it will be done automatically anyway when the
underlying connection is closed.

In some situations, you may want the connection to close automatically
once the last open channel on the connection closes. To achieve this,
set the [code IConnection.AutoClose] property to true, but only [b
after] creating the first channel:

@code java
 IConnection conn = factory.CreateConnection(...);
 IModel channel = conn.CreateModel();
 conn.AutoClose = true;

When [code AutoClose] is true, the last channel to close will also
cause the connection to close[footnote See [code
RabbitMQ.Client.Impl.SessionManager.CheckAutoClose()] for the
implementation of this feature.]. If it is set to true before any
channel is created, the connection will close then and there.

** Using exchanges and queues

Client applications work with exchanges and queues, the high-level
building blocks of AMQP. These must be "declared" before they can be
used. Declaring either type of object simply ensures that one of that
name exists, creating it if necessary.

Continuing the previous example, the following code declares an
exchange and a queue, then binds them together.

@code java
 channel.ExchangeDeclare(exchangeName, ExchangeType.Direct);
 channel.QueueDeclare(queueName);
 channel.QueueBind(queueName, exchangeName, routingKey, false, null);

This will actively declare the following objects:

 # a non-durable, non-autodelete exchange of "direct" type
 # a non-durable, non-exclusive, non-autodelete queue

both of which can be customised by using additional parameters. Here
neither of them have any special arguments.

The above code then binds the queue to the exchange with the given
routing key.

Note that these Channel API methods are overloaded. These convenient
short forms of ExchangeDeclare and QueueDeclare use sensible
defaults. There are also longer forms with more parameters, to let you
override these defaults as necessary, giving full control where
needed.

This "short version, long version" pattern is used throughout the API.

** Publishing messages

To publish a message to an exchange, use [code IModel.BasicPublish] as
follows:

@code java
 byte[] messageBodyBytes = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("Hello, world!");
 channel.BasicPublish(exchangeName, routingKey, null, messageBodyBytes);

For fine control, you can use overloaded variants to specify the
mandatory and immediate flags, or send messages with basic-class
header properties:

@code java
 byte[] messageBodyBytes = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("Hello, world!");
 IBasicProperties props = channel.CreateBasicProperties();
 props.ContentType = "text/plain";
 props.DeliveryMode = 2;
 channel.BasicPublish(exchangeName,
                      routingKey, props,
                      messageBodyBytes);

This sends a message with delivery mode 2 (persistent) and
content-type "text/plain". See the definition of the [code
IBasicProperties] interface for more information about the available
header properties.

** Retrieving individual messages

To retrieve individual messages, use [code IModel.BasicGet]. The
returned value is an instance of BasicGetResult, from which the header
information (properties) and message body can be extracted:

@code java
 bool noAck = false;
 BasicGetResult result = channel.BasicGet(queueName, noAck);
 if (result == null) {
     // No message available at this time.
 } else {
     IBasicProperties props = result.BasicProperties;
     byte[] body = result.Body;
     ...

Since [code noAck = false] above, you must also call [code
IModel.BasicAck] to acknowledge that you have successfully received
and processed the message:

@code java
     ...
     // acknowledge receipt of the message
     channel.BasicAck(result.DeliveryTag, false);
 }

** Retrieving messages by subscription

Another way to receive messages is to set up a subscription using the
[code IBasicConsumer] interface. The messages will then be delivered
automatically as they arrive, rather than having to be requested
proactively.

The easiest and safest way to implement a consumer is to use the
convenience class [code QueueingBasicConsumer], and retrieve
deliveries from the [code SharedQueue] instance contained therein:

@code java
 QueueingBasicConsumer consumer = new QueueingBasicConsumer(channel);
 channel.BasicConsume(queueName, null, consumer);
 while (true) {
     try {
         RabbitMQ.Client.Events.BasicDeliverEventArgs e =
           (RabbitMQ.Client.Events.BasicDeliverEventArgs)
           consumer.Queue.Dequeue();
         IBasicProperties props = e.BasicProperties;
         byte[] body = e.Body;
         // ... process the message
         channel.BasicAck(e.DeliveryTag, false);
     } catch (OperationInterruptedException ex) {
         // The consumer was removed, either through
         // channel or connection closure, or through the
         // action of IModel.BasicCancel().
         break;
     }
 }

Another alternative is to subclass [code DefaultBasicConsumer],
overriding methods as necessary, or implement [code IBasicConsumer]
directly. You will generally want to implement the core method [code
HandleBasicDeliver].

More sophisticated consumers will need to implement further
methods. In particular, [code HandleModelShutdown] traps
channel/connection closure. Consumers can also implement [code
HandleBasicCancelOk] to be notified of cancellations.

The [code ConsumerTag] property of [code DefaultBasicConsumer] can be
used to retrieve the server-generated consumer tag, in cases where
none was supplied to the original [code IModel.BasicConsume] call.

You can cancel an active consumer with [code IModel.BasicCancel]:

@code java
 channel.BasicCancel(consumerTag);

When calling the API methods, you always refer to consumers by their
consumer tags, which can be either client- or server-generated as
explained in the AMQP specification document.

** Threading, deadlocks, and associated restrictions on consumers

Each [code IConnection] instance is, in the current implementation,
backed by a single background thread that reads from the socket and
dispatches the resulting events to the application.
Additionally there are two threads responsible for [code Heartbeat] support,
if connection negotiation turned it on.

Usually, therefore, there will be four threads active in an application
using this library:

 - the application thread: contains the application logic, and makes
   calls on [code IModel] methods to perform AMQP operations.

 - the connection thread: hidden away and completely managed by the
   [code IConnection] instance.
   
 - the heartbeat read thread: continuously checking if [code IConnection]
   instance has not missed too many [code Heartbeat] frames from the broker
 
 - the heartbeat write thread: continuosuly checking if [code IConnection]
   instance should send [code Heartbeat] frame to the broker

The one place where the nature of the threading model is visible to
the application is in any callback the application registers with the
library. Such callbacks include:

 - any [code IBasicConsumer] method

 - the [code BasicReturn] event on [code IModel]

 - any of the various shutdown events on [code IConnection], [code
   IModel] etc.

Application callback handlers [b must not] invoke blocking AMQP
operations (such as [code IModel.QueueDeclare] or [code
IModel.BasicCancel]). If they do, the channel will deadlock[footnote
The underlying implementation reason is that the [code IBasicConsumer]
callbacks are invoked in the connection's thread rather than in the
application's thread.].

Only asynchronous AMQP operations are safe for use within callbacks,
such as:

 - [code IModel.BasicAck]
 - [code IModel.BasicPublish]

For this reason, [code QueueingBasicConsumer] is the safest way of
subscribing to a queue, because its implementation uses [code
RabbitMQ.Util.SharedQueue] to pass deliveries over to the application
thread, where all processing of received deliveries is done, and where
any AMQP [code IModel] operation is safe.

** IModel should not be shared between threads

In general, [code IModel] instances should not be used by more than
one thread simultaneously: application code should maintain a clear
notion of thread ownership for [code IModel] instances.

If more than one thread needs to access a particular [code IModel]
instances, the application should enforce mutual exclusion itself. One
way of achieving this is for all users of an [code IModel] to [code
lock] the instance itself:

@code java
  IModel ch = RetrieveSomeSharedIModelInstance();
  lock (ch) {
    ch.BasicPublish(...);
  }

Symptoms of incorrect serialisation of [code IModel] operations
include, but are not limited to,

 - invalid frame sequences being sent on the wire (which occurs, for
   example, if more than one [code BasicPublish] operation is run
   simultaneously), and/or

 - [code NotSupportedException]s being thrown from a method in class
   [code RpcContinuationQueue] complaining about [code "Pipelining of
   requests forbidden"] (which occurs in situations where more than
   one AMQP RPC, such as [code ExchangeDeclare], is run
   simultaneously).

** Handling unroutable or undelivered messages

If a message is published with the "mandatory" or "immediate" flags
set, but cannot be delivered, the broker will return it to the sending
client (via a [code basic.return] AMQP command).

To be notified of such returns, clients can subscribe to the [code
IModel.BasicReturn] event.  If there are no listeners attached to the
event, then returned messages will be silently dropped.

@code java
 channel.BasicReturn +=
   new RabbitMQ.Client.Events.BasicReturnEventHandler(...);

The [code BasicReturn] event will fire, for example, if the client
publishes a message with the "mandatory" flag set to an exchange of
"direct" type which is not bound to a queue.

** QPid-compatible JMS BytesMessage, StreamMessage, and MapMessage codecs

The [code RabbitMQ.Client.Content] namespace contains classes and
interfaces that implement QPid-compatible JMS BytesMessage,
StreamMessage and MapMessage encoders and decoders.

For example, to construct (and send) a MapMessage:

@code java
  IModel channel = ...;

  IMapMessageBuilder b = new MapMessageBuilder(channel);
  b.Headers["header1"] = "some@random.string";
  b.Body["field1"] = 123.45;
  b.Body["field2"] = new byte[] { 1, 2, 3 };

  channel.BasicPublish(exchange, routingKey,
                       (IBasicProperties)  b.GetContentHeader(),
                       b.GetContentBody());

A StreamMessage is similar (and BytesMessages are so similar to
StreamMessages that I shan't demonstrate them here):

@code java
  IStreamMessageBuilder b = new StreamMessageBuilder(channel);
  b.Headers["header1"] = "some@random.string";
  b.WriteDouble(123.45);
  b.WriteBytes(new byte[] { 1, 2, 3 });

Given a received message in the form of an [code IBasicProperties]
header and a [code byte[]] body, reading the message as a MapMessage
is done with [code IMapMessageReader]:

@code java
  IBasicProperties props = ...;
  byte[] receivedBody = ...;
  IMapMessageReader r = new MapMessageReader(props, receivedBody);
  Console.Out.WriteLine("Header1: {0}", r.Headers["header1"]);
  Console.Out.WriteLine("Field1: {0}", r.Body["field1"]);
  Console.Out.WriteLine("Field2: {0}", r.Body["field2"]);

StreamMessages (and BytesMessages) are similar:

@code java
  IStreamMessageReader r = new StreamMessageReader(props, receivedBody);
  Console.Out.WriteLine("Header1: {0}", r.Headers["header1"]);
  Console.Out.WriteLine("First value: {0}", r.ReadDouble());
  Console.Out.WriteLine("Second value: {0}", r.ReadBytes());
