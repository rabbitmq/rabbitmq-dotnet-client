Notes when creating a new VS project:

- The easiest way to create a new project is probably using Visual Studio
(takes care of the solution file)

- Add all the source files to the projects now (if you already have the sources)

- After creating the new project, manually edit the .csproj
file (you might want to quit Visual Studio beforehand) and make it look like
all the other projects' .csproj files:

i.e.:
- Import the Local.props file

- Rename the OutputPath property in all configurations to build\bin\:

  <OutputPath>build\bin\</OutputPath>

- Change the TargetFrameworkVersion property to $(PropTargetFramework):

  <TargetFrameworkVersion>$(PropTargetFramework)</TargetFrameworkVersion>

- Copy-paste the "mono workarounds" bit

- It's probably best to add new files by hand in the project (by copying the
file to the appropriate location and editing the .csproj by hand)

- If you happen to edit a project's settings in Visual Studio, make sure
the corresponding .csproj doesn't loose any customization.
